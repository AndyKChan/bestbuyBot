i'm going to ask which product the user wants to know user reviews on

then im going to use bestbuy api to give me the product id

then i'll use that product id to query the the user review msgs

then i'll compare these msgs with my luis models 






right now

a user types something, and depending on what they say, it links to a function that does something

i want to compare the msgs in the reviews, and save which ever keywords generate more matches.


i need to send in the reviews as my own msgs and compare them to luis.


dialog.onDefault([

    function (session) {
        builder.Prompts.text(session, 'Hi! How may I help you today?');
    },
	
    function (session, results) {
        session.userData.name = results.response;
        session.endDialog();
    }
]);
